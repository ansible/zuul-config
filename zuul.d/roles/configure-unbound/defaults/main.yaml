# Time to live maximum for  RRsets  and  messages  in  the  cache.
# Default  is  86400  seconds  (1  day).  If the maximum kicks in,
# responses to clients still get decrementing TTLs  based  on  the
# original  (larger)  values.   When the internal TTL expires, the
# cache item has expired.  Can be set lower to force the  resolver
# to query for data often, and not trust (very large) TTL values.

# Time  to  live  minimum  for  RRsets  and messages in the cache.
# Default is 0.  If the minimum kicks in, the data is  cached  for
# longer than the domain owner intended, and thus less queries are
# made to look up the data.  Zero makes sure the data in the cache
# is  as the domain owner intended, higher values, especially more
# than an hour or so, can lead to trouble as the data in the cache
# does not match up with the actual data any more.
