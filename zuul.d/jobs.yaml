# Shared zuul config specific to the Ansible Project
# Contains definitions of trusted jobs
# Overrides jobs from:
#    https://github.com/ansible-network/ansible-zuul-jobs

# Changes to this job require a special procedure, because they can
# not be tested before landing, and if they are faulty, they will
# break all jobs, meaning subsequent corrections will not be able to
# land.  To make a change:
#
# 1) Ensure that base-minimal-test and its playbooks are identical to
#    base-minimal.
# 2) Make the change to base-minimal-test and/or its playbooks.
# 3) Merge the change from step 2.  No jobs normally use
#    base-minimal-test, so this is safe.
# 4) Propose a change to a job to reparent it to base-minimal-test.
#    Choose a job which will exercise whatever you are changing.  The
#    "unittests" job in zuul-jobs is a good choice.  Use [DNM] in the
#    commit subject so that people know not to merge the change.  Set
#    it to "Work in progress" so people don't review it.
# 5) Once test results arrive for the change in step 2, make a change
#    which copies the job and/or playbooks of base-minimal-test to
#    base-minimal. In the commit message, link to (without using
#    Depends-On:) the change from step 4 so reviewers can see the
#    test results.
# 6) Once the change in step 5 merges, abandon the change from step 4.
